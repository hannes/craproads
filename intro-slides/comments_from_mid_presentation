Bike-lane centric!

Comments:
- Look at iSPEX
  * Result: not applicable incentive model (they expect people to pay for the sensors)

Ideas:
- Give feedback to the user about what happened with the report or if it is fixed or when it is fixed 
	* If your potholes gets fixed you will get points. Gamification!
	* More points with better information
- Look at other possible stakeholders, 
	* Eneco (to give away promotion dynamos), 
    * bike rental companies (to install devices and get back info on their customer's preferred routes 
							+ improving bike lanes quality decreases the need for bike maintenance)
- Use the niche of sportive cyclists. They are probably more interested to report on roads and maybe get a kick out of it? 
	* social media mining, find out their digital venues
	* visual information retrieval on uploaded camera footage
- Detect changing behavior - construct user templates and profiles
- Client-side receives updates based only on the subscription query
- Make the framework available as an API
- Integrate meteo-data and weather forecasts (glazed frost)
- Include other data about the road:
    * Type of surface
    * The quality of the air, CO2 levels
    * Noise levels
    * Busyness of the road
    * Separate bicycle lane or on the same road with cars
    * Change in height
    * Enough light?
    * Well signaled?
    * What kind of scenery? e.g.  Amount of trees
    * typical participants in traffic for a specific lane (percentages of bikers, scooters, joggers etc)
- heterogeneous data sources   
	* joggers, most likely to take a photo of a pothole, report branches and leaves 
	* scooters?
	
    
Problems:
- How to cope with false positives of de detector?
- How do we store the data
- Privacy issues
- Battery drainage
- Position of smartphone


Benefits for the end-user:
- Route-planner (turn-by-turn)
- Record route history
- Share recorded routes with friends
- Calorie-counter
- Shows maintenance on route and detours
- Shows bad parts of the road

Benefits for intermediate users (developers of apps):
- A framework that provides info which may be combined with other sources to build new apps:
	* Historical sites based on the GPS coordinates
	* Bird-viewing    

Benefits for RWS:
- Damaged pavement is detected faster, repair costs are smaller.
- Quality of their maintenance rises due to better planning
- Better insight in road usage by bikers
